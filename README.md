# WNBA

The goal for this project is to use the data provided in this repository (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/WNBA-stats) in order to create sample Tableau visualizations.

The dashboards created are available <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david1924/viz/WNBA1/TopHistoricalPlayerStats">on Tableau Public here</a>.

The CSV files are included here for convenience. Please visit https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/WNBA-stats for more information regarding the data.
